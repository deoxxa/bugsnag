Overview
--------

Package echologrus provides a library for sending data to the bugsnag error
reporting service. It differs from the official library by having special
support for [github.com/facebookgo/stackerr](http://github.com/facebookgo/stackerr)
and a more complete data model.

See the [documentation on GoDoc](https://godoc.org/fknsrs.biz/p/bugsnag).
